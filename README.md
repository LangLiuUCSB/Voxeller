# Voxeller 2024

Voxeller is a pathfinding agent developed by Lang Liu, an undergraduate student of applied mathematics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Coded in C++, Voxeller is designed to search in high-dimensional lattice environments of orthogonal navigability that leverages precomputation of connected components, bidirectional A-star and or GBeFS, fork-join parallelism, memoization, and optimizations using bitwise-operations.

## TODO STACK

- fork-join parallelism
- path storage and subset search
- benchmark other types of heaps
- heuristics tuning
- system dependent space optimization
- fileread optimization
