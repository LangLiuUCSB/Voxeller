# Voxeller 2024

Voxeller is a pathfinding agent developed by Lang Liu, an undergraduate student of applied mathematics and statistics & data science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Developed in C++, Voxeller is designed to search in high-dimensional grid-based orthogonal-traversal environments. High-speed runtime performance is achieved through bidirectional search, graph condensation, chain memoization, fork-join parallelism, and optimizations using bitwise-operations.

## TODO STACK

- reduce redundant deallocation and reallocation
- chain memoization
- fork-join parallelism
- benchmark other types of heaps
- heuristics tuning
- system dependent space optimization
- fileread optimization
