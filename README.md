# Voxeller 2024

Voxeller is a pathfinding agent developed by Lang Liu, an undergraduate student of applied mathematics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Coded in C++, Voxeller is designed to search in high-dimensional lattice environments of orthogonal navigability that leverages precomputation of connected components, bidirectional A-star and or GBeFS, fork-join parallelism, memoization, and optimizations using bitwise-operations.
